## Security Best Practices

### API Keys & Secrets
- Never commit API keys, secrets, or credentials to version control
- Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
- Rotate keys regularly and revoke unused keys
- Use different keys for development, staging, and production

### Environment Variables
Required environment variables (create `.env` file):
```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
REDIS_URL=your_redis_url
NEO4J_URL=your_neo4j_url

# Authentication
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your_oauth_client_id
OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=your_oauth_client_secret

# External APIs
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
AZURE_COGNITIVE_KEY=your_azure_key
GOOGLE_AI_KEY=your_google_ai_key

# Email & Communications
SMTP_HOST=your_smtp_host
SMTP_USER=your_smtp_user
SMTP_PASS=your_smtp_password

# Production Only
NODE_ENV=production
SSL_CERT_PATH=path_to_ssl_cert
SSL_KEY_PATH=path_to_ssl_key
```

### Pre-commit Security Checks
Run these checks before every commit:
```bash
# Check for secrets
git secrets --scan
grep -r "api_key\|secret\|password\|token" . --exclude-dir=node_modules

# Check for exposed credentials
npm audit
yarn audit

# Validate environment variables
node -e "console.log(require('dotenv').config())"
```

### Open Core Security
- Premium features are kept in private repositories
- Business logic and pricing models are not exposed
- Enterprise authentication is handled separately
- Customer data is encrypted and stored securely
